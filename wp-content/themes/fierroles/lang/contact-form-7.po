msgid "On this screen, you can manage contact forms provided by Contact Form 7. You can manage an unlimited number of contact forms.

msgstr ""

msgid "Hovering over a row in the contact forms list will display action links that allow you to manage your contact form. You can perform the following actions:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<strong>Edit</strong> - Navigates to the editing screen for that contact form. You can also reach that screen by clicking on the contact form title."
msgstr ""

msgid "<strong>Duplicate</strong> - Clones that contact form. A cloned contact form inherits all content from the original, but has a different ID."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can add a new contact form on this screen. You can create a contact form in your language, which is set WordPress local settings, or in a language that you select from available options."
msgstr ""

msgid "On this screen, you can edit a contact form. A contact form is comprised of the following components:"
msgstr ""

msgid "<strong>Title</strong> is the title of a contact form. This title is only used for labeling a contact form, and can be edited."
msgstr ""

msgid "<strong>Form</strong> is a content of HTML form. You can use arbitrary HTML, which is allowed inside a form element. You can also use Contact Form 7&#8217;s form-tags here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<strong>Mail</strong> manages a mail template (headers and message body) that this contact form will send when users submit it. You can use Contact Form 7&#8217;s mail-tags here."
msgstr ""

msgid "<strong>Mail (2)</strong> is an additional mail template that works similar to Mail. Mail (2) is different in that it is sent only when Mail has been sent successfully."
msgstr ""

msgid "In <strong>Messages</strong>, you can edit various types of messages used for this contact form. These messages are relatively short messages, like a validation error message you see when you leave a required field blank."
msgstr ""

msgid "<strong>Additional Settings</strong> provides a place where you can customize the behavior of this contact form by adding code snippets."
msgstr ""

msgid "A form-tag is a short code enclosed in square brackets used in a form content. A form-tag generally represents an input field, and its components can be separated into four parts: type, name, options, and values. Contact Form 7 supports several types of form-tags including text fields, number fields, date fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, menus, file-uploading fields, CAPTCHAs, and quiz fields."
msgstr ""

msgid "While form-tags have a comparatively complex syntax, you don&#8217;t need to know the syntax to add form-tags because you can use the straightforward tag generator (<strong>Generate Tag</strong> button on this screen)."
msgstr ""

msgid "A mail-tag is also a short code enclosed in square brackets that you can use in every Mail and Mail (2) field. A mail-tag represents a user input value through an input field of a corresponding form-tag."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are also special mail-tags that have specific names, but don&#8217;t have corresponding form-tags. They are used to represent meta information of form submissions like the submitter&#8217;s IP address or the URL of the page."
